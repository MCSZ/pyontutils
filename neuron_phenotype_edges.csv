#intrinsic phenotypes,,,,,
hasMolecularPhenotype,"MolecularConstituents, Neurotransmitter/NeurotransmitterReceptors",,"Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a molecule type. This should be used for direct detection of the molecule, whether it is a small molecule or a peptide.",,
hasExpressionPhenotype,"MolecularConstituents, Neurotransmitter/NeurotransmitterReceptors",,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a gene type. This should be used for detection of RNAs that code for proteins which may or may not have been detected directly.,,
,,,,,
hasMorphologicalPhenotype,"SpineDensityOnDendrites, CellSomaSize, CellSomaShape",,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a morphological phenotype concept. This should be used when a neuron type is described using a high level morphological concept class.,,
hasElectrophysiologicalPhenotype,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and an electrophysiological phenotype concept. This should be used when a neuron type is described using a high level electrophysiological concept class.,,
hasDevelopmentalOrigin,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a developmental cell population. This should be used when a neuron develops from an identified developmental cell population.,needs work,
#intrinsic/extrinsic phenotypes,,,,,
hasProjectionPhenotype,Has role,,,,"this might be clearer  than hasCircuitRole… but might confuse with projectsTo or the like…, excitatory/inhibitory shouldn't be handled here?"
hasSomaLocatedIn,Located in,,,,
hasDendriteLocatedIn,DendriteLocation,,,,
hasAxonLocatedIn,"LocationOfAxonArborization, LocationOfLocalAxonArborization",,,,
hasPresynapticTerminalsIn,,,,,
hasInstanceInSpecies,Species/taxa,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a species. This should be used when a neuron type has been observed in a specific species.,,
isAncestralInTaxon,Species/taxa,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a taxon. This should be used when a neuron type is thought to have been present in the last common ancestor of the taxon.,,
