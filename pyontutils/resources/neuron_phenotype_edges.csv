hasIntrinsicPhenotype,,,,,,hasPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasMolecularPhenotype,"MolecularConstituents, Neurotransmitter/NeurotransmitterReceptors",,"Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a molecule type. This should be used for direct detection of the molecule, whether it is a small molecule or a peptide.",,,hasExpressionPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasExpressionPhenotype,"MolecularConstituents, Neurotransmitter/NeurotransmitterReceptors",,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a gene type. This should be used for detection of RNAs that code for proteins which may or may not have been detected directly.,,,hasIntrinsicPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasNeurotransmitterPhenotype,Neurotransmitter,,,,not entirely sure if we need this one,hasExpressionPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasMorphologicalPhenotype,"SpineDensityOnDendrites, CellSomaSize, CellSomaShape",,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a morphological phenotype concept. This should be used when a neuron type is described using a high level morphological concept class.,,,hasIntrinsicPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasElectrophysiologicalPhenotype,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and an electrophysiological phenotype concept. This should be used when a neuron type is described using a high level electrophysiological concept class.,,,hasIntrinsicPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"

#hasSustainedSpikingPhenotype,,,,,ilx:hasSustainedFiringPhenotype,hasSpikingPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive, functional"
hasDevelopmentalOrigin,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a developmental cell population. This should be used when a neuron develops from an identified developmental cell population.,needs work,,,,
#intrinsic/extrinsic phenotypes,,,,,,,,
hasExtrinsicPhenotype,,,,,,hasPhenotype,,
hasProjectionPhenotype,Has role,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a brain region that said neuron type sends axons to.,,"this might be clearer  than hasCircuitRole… but might confuse with projectsTo or the like…, excitatory/inhibitory shouldn't be handled here?",hasPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasLayerLocationPhenotype,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a laminer brain region.,,May need hasSomaLayerLocation or something,hasLocationPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasLocationPhenotype,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a brain region or brain parcel. This is a superProperty and should not be used directly.,,,hasExtrinsicPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"

hasPresynapticTerminalsIn,,,,,,,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasInstanceInSpecies,Species/taxa,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a species. This should be used when a neuron type has been observed in a specific species.,,,hasExtrinsicPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasTaxonRank,Species/taxa,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a taxon. This should be used when a neuron type is thought to have been present in the last common ancestor of the taxon.,,isAncestralInTaxon (because convergent evolution is SOOO likely…),hasExtrinsicPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
phenotypeObservedInBrainRegion,,Located in?,Expresses a relationship between a phenotype and a brain region. This should be used when a neuron phenotype is observed in specific brain regions.,,existential not universal,,,
phenotypeCooccuresWith,,,Expresses a relationship between a phenotype and a phenotype. This should be used when two phenotypes commonly cooccure.,,"this is not the right way to pull this off, need something akin to disjointness",,,
