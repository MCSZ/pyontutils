    "Neuron Lang is a python based DSL for naming neurons. Neurons are modelled as collections of phenotypes with semantics backed by Web Ontology Language (OWL2) classes. Neuron Lang provides tools for mapping to and from collections of local names for phenotypes by using ontology identifiers as the common language underlying all local naming. These tools also let us automatically generate names for neurons in a regular and consistent way using a set of rules operating on the neurons' constitutent phenotypes. Neuron Lang can export to python or to any serialziation supported by rdflib, however [deterministic turtle](https://github.com/tgbugs/pyontutils/blob/master/docs/ttlser.md) (ttl) is prefered.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has examples of how to use Neuron Lang to:\n",
    "* Define neurons and phenotypes.\n",
    "* Export all defined neurons.\n",
    "* Use `%scig` magic to search for existing ontology identifiers\n",
    "* Use `LocalNameManager` to create abbreviations for phenotypes.\n",
    "* Bind local names in the current python namespace using `with` or `setLocalNames`.\n",
    "* Creat a phenotype context in which to define neurons using `with` or `setLocalContext`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see [the documentation](https://github.com/tgbugs/pyontutils/blob/master/docs/neurons_notebook.md) in order to set up a working\n",
