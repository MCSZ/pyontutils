** Publishing
   Tangle both blocks here =C-c C-v C-t= (=t= also works) and then you
   can publish this document by running =../bin/publish-sawg= with
   =AUX_RESOLVER_HOST= set in your environment (.e.g via =~/.bashrc=).

* Overview
  The Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) effort is the result of National Institutes of Healthâ€™s (NIH) 
  drive to map out the neural circuitry responsible for visceral control in higher vertebrates.  The SPARC Anatomy Working Group (SAWG) 
  is headed by one of the three Data and Resource Center (DRC) cores, Map Synthesis Core (MAP-CORE). SAWG is composed of a group of 
  expert anatomists with a goal of: 

  - Compiling and extending controlled lists of anatomical terms 
  - Standardizing flat map schematics and experimental data 
  - Designing simple topological organ models and their connections  

  This page provides access to the data generated by the SAWG which includes links to documentation about vocabulary services, 
  term request and connectivity. This page will be continuously updated. 


* 1. Terminology

** 1.1 Terminology review
   If you are here to provide expert review of terminology for SPARC here is a table!
