# ttlser
Deterministic turtle serialization for rdflib.

See the [docs](./docs/ttlser.md) for the full specification and
details on the implemention.

ttlser also includes a number of other turtle serializers for
specific rendering needs.

Provides a `ttlfmt` script that can convert any rdflib supported
format into the output format supported by the serializers or any
other rdflib serializer.
