A data model for neuron types.

## Neuron Types
If you have found your way to this repository because you are interested in using neuron-lang for
describing neuron types please see [this introduction](http://ontology.neuinfo.org/docs/NIF-Ontology/docs/Neurons.html)
to the general approach.  To get started all you need to do is follow the installation instructions above and then include
`from neurondm.lang import *` in your import statements. Please see the documentation for how to
[set up neuron-lang for jupyter notebooks](docs/neurons_notebook.md) and take a look at some
[examples of how to use neuron-lang to create new neurons](docs/NeuronLangExample.ipynb).
