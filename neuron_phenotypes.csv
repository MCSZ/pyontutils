#intrinsic phenotypes,,,,
hasMolecularPhenotype,"MolecularConstituents, Neurotransmitter/NeurotransmitterReceptors",,"Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a molecule type. This should be used for direct detection of the molecule, whether it is a small molecule or a peptide.",
hasExpressionPhenotype,"MolecularConstituents, Neurotransmitter/NeurotransmitterReceptors",,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a gene type. This should be used for detection of RNAs that code for proteins which may or may not have been detected directly.,
,,,,
hasMorphologicalPhenotype,"SpineDensityOnDendrites, CellSomaSize, CellSomaShape",,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a morphological phenotype concept. This should be used when a neuron type is described using a high level morphological concept class.,
hasElectrophysiologicalPhenotype,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and an electrophysiological phenotype concept. This should be used when a neuron type is described using a high level electrophysiological concept class.,
#intrinsic/extrinsic phenotypes,,,,
hasProjectionPhenotype,Has role,,,"this might be clearer  than hasCircuitRole… but might confuse with projectsTo or the like…, excitatory/inhibitory shouldn't be handled here?"
hasSomaLocatedIn,Located in,,,
hasDendriteLocatedIn,DendriteLocation,,,
hasAxonLocatedIn,"LocationOfAxonArborization, LocationOfLocalAxonArborization",,,
hasPresynapticTerminalsIn,,,,
hasInstanceInSpecies,Species/taxa,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a species. This should be used when a neuron type has been observed in a specific species.,
isAncestralInTaxon,Species/taxa,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a taxon. This should be used when a neuron type is thought to have been present in the last common ancestor of the taxon.,
